# dsa-colloquium

Tech demo for DSA-201

## Here's a level 2 section!

And then there's some text below.

### This is a thing I did on my local machine.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

i94_metro_interstate_traffic <- read_csv("C:/Users/Admin/Downloads/i94_metro_interstate_traffic.csv")

```
## Hour of day
```{r}
traffic_volume_avgs <- i94_metro_interstate_traffic %>% 
    group_by(dt_hour) %>%
    summarize(
        avg = mean(traffic_volume)
        )
traffic_volume_avgs %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = dt_hour, y = avg)) +
   geom_line() +
   labs(
     title = "Average Traffic Volume at Different Hours",
     x = "Hour of Day",
     y = "Average Traffic Volume"
)
```
